# zi-personal-web
Block 12 first personal webiste project part II <br>

This is an updated version for Personal Website Pt II <br>
* Github repository: https://github.com/fang10000/zi-personal-web <br>
* Used CSS grid and flex to acheive similar layout as in Pt I but more flexible to change view for mobile version using media queries 
* Used transition effect when nevigating between pages and the buttons on Home page change color on hover; did not use z-index given the layout won't require z-index
* The contact form was already there in Pt I; no enhancements were made other than making the Submit button leading to another page to show successful submission <br>

To be enhanced:
* The Contact page is not yet mobile friendly; need to add style-contact.css to specify
* Footer is removed comapring to part I given some formatting issues; need to add back.
